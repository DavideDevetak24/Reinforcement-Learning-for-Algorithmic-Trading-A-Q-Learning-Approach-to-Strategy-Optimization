# Trading_Strategies_Q_Learning

This project analyzes two trading strategies: the first one is a simple rule-based strategy, the second one uses a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach using Q-Learning.

To ensure replicability, I used the function set.seed(). Additionally, I implemented a cycle in the Q-Learning algorithm to explore a wider range of results, improving robustness and providing a more reliable comparison between the strategies.

This approach aims to compare the effectiveness of traditional technical indicators versus an adaptive learning-based method in trading.
